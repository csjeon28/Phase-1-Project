API Documentation:
https://covid-19.dataflowkit.com/v1

Objective of Phase 1 JavaScript Project: 
* Pull data from a public API
* Manipulate that data
* Build a Single Page Application utilizing HTML/CSS/JS frontend

My Application: 
My application shows a COVID-19 Live Tracker with live (updated every hour) statistics of each country in the API database.
You can view statistics, including total active cases, new cases, total cases, new deaths, total deaths, and total recovered, 
for each country, by selecting from a dropdown menu. Each country also has a select button available to show the total sum 
of total active cases of the selected countries. 

User Stories:
1. As a user, I can use a dropdown menu to select a country to view all of the country's COVID statistics.

2. As a user, I can use a dropdown menu to sort all countries by:
        * alphabetical order
        * highest number of cases
        * lowest number of cases

3. As a user, I can calculate the sum of cases for selected countries in a list.
        * I can click a plus button next to each country in the list to select it and add number of cases to the sum.
        * I can click a check button next to each country in the list to deselect it and remove number of cases from the sum.
