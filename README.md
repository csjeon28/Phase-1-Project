# Phase-1-Project

User Stories:
1. As a user, I can select a country to view the country's COVID statistics.

2. As a user, I can use a dropdown menu to sort all countries by:
        * alphabetical order
        * highest number of cases
        * lowest number of cases

3. As a user, I can calculate the sum of cases for selected countries in a list.
        * I can click a country in the list to select it and add number of cases to the sum.
        * I can click a country in the list to deselect it and remove number of cases from the sum.
