# Phase-1-Project: My Live COVID Tracker

My single page application is a COVID-19 Tracker with live (updated hourly) statistics of each country in the API database.
* You can view statistics for each country, including:
  * total active cases
  * new cases
  * total cases
  * new deaths
  * total deaths
  * total recovered
* Each country also has a select button available to show the total sum of total active cases of the selected countries.
* Features a dropdown menu to filter countries by alphabetical, highest, and lowest number of cases.

## Objective of Phase 1 JavaScript Project: 
* Pull data from a public API
* Manipulate that data
* Build a Single Page Application utilizing HTML/CSS/JS frontend

## User Stories:
1. As a user, I can use a dropdown menu to select a country to view all of the country's COVID statistics.

2. As a user, I can use a dropdown menu to sort all countries by:
  * alphabetical order
  * highest number of cases
  * lowest number of cases

3. As a user, I can calculate the sum of cases for selected countries in a list.
  * I can click a plus button next to each country in the list to select it and add number of cases to the sum.
  * I can click a check button next to each country in the list to deselect it and remove number of cases from the sum.
